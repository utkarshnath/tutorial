I was not the topper in my college, but surely was one of the richest students around in college. In sophomore year, when most of the students were starting to learn basics of data structures, I was freelancing and making android apps for startups. In junior year, I was teaching algorithms and data structures at an education firm named Coding blocks and later in the same year I qualified for GSOC. These endeavours helped me earn money, but made me the richest in terms of the skills and experience I gained and the qualities I imbibed, giving me a clear picture how I wanted to drive myself further. 

Establish the fact that you have interest in algorithms and machine learning

From childhood days, mathematics has been my favourite subject, it attracted me because there is nothing to be memorized. Everything in mathematics is simply based on logic and if  I were to forget some formula, then it could be simply derived using my previous knowledge. Then I was introduced to programing as a fresher in college. Programming is similar to mathematics, here too we first solve different small problems and then join them to solve the bigger original problem. I still clearly remember my first programming class, our professor started the class with a question. He asked us to tell the hundredth prime number within 10 minutes. After everyone failed, he simply wrote a few line of code and within seconds, we saw 541 printed on the screen.  A few lines of code had magically solved a problem which human brain wasn’t able to solve. This small exercise had a huge impact on my career, though I didn’t understand the exact code that day, I knew this was something I would love to do for the rest of my life. After this I became very passionate about programming, I went well beyond the prescribed syllabus, learned different data structures, read numerous algorithms and started making different android applications. At the end of my freshman year I was getting freelancing offers that usually a junior or senior year student would get. I thought early development can be very beneficial and thus started a coding society in college named ‘Code Junkies’. Here me and my friend taught algorithms and data structures. Our society was a success, the number of students increased every week.  

In my second year, I enrolled in a course “blah blah”. One of the requirements of the course was a research project in any area of my choice. Searching about the current trends in computer science, I stumbled upon the world of Machine Learning.  A topic which has continued to fascinate and intrigue me since. My first foray into Machine Learning was an online course by Prof. Andrew Ng. at Stanford. Machine Learning had elements of mathematics and algorithms, two areas for which I always had keen inclination. Naturally, I took to this area like ‘fish to water’. 

For my undergraduate research project, I implemented it’s algorithms on some of my basic projects like facial expression detection and movie recommender systems. I presented both of them as minor project in junior year and for both of the them were ranked in top ten projects of the batch. SOME MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE PROJECT

While working on recommender systems, I stumbled upon a paper titled ‘Clustering using same-cluster queries’ which appeared at NIPS 2016. I had some questions and suggestions, so I contacted the authors of this paper. After a few email exchanges, we started working on a small research problem. ‘Convergence properties of K-means with and without queries’. Given a set of data points, Clustering aims to partition them such that similar points are in the same group while simultaneously separating the dissimilar points. One popular clustering algorithm is called K-means clustering. Although widely used in practice, the algorithm rather surprisingly comes with very few theoretical guaranties. It is known that K-means algorithm can get stuck at a local minima. Under what conditions would k-means reach a global minima? On what datasets should k-means be applied? These are some important questions which do not have satisfactory answers in current literature. In this project, we tried to answer this questions. I performed certain experiments which showed that if data consists of well separated balls then with high probability  the kmeans algorithm does not get stuck at a local minima. We complemented our experiments with theoretical guarantees which showed that this should always happen as long as the separation between the balls is at least four times the radius. Working on the problem gave me opportunity to interact with Prof. Yaoliang Yu  and some of his Phd students at the University of Waterloo. This was first experience of how graduate-level research looks like. 


Also I did a research work as part of my undergraduate coursework. It was based on clustering of categorical data. Unlike numerical data, categorical data is not easily classifiable as it is not possible, rather logical to determine exactly by what measure a category is different from another. We proposed a formula to approximate this difference between two categories. The results were improved. We also tried to develop a formula which could work on both or either of the two, categorical and numerical data. We developed a method for that but due to the performance not being upto mark we had to stop there.

The projects that you have done will establish your research inclination.  
Then establish your research inclination, np hard problems

I have always liked hard problems and what could be harder than np hard. The above mentioned projects gave me the opportunity to do in-depth analysis of some of the np-hard problems.

something about np hard problems, why they are important?

What exactly do you want to do if received an admit?

I want to conduct further research in this field. I want to answer questions like in what conditions can the np hard problems reach a global minima, what constraints can we apply to solve it in polynomial time ?

why this university and why these prof  







Besides my research and projects,one more thing that I have always tried to put my time and  effort into is giving my share of knowledge back to the society. Apart from teaching algorithms at Coding blocks and Code Junkies, I was also the Google facilitator for the year 2017-2018. I was appointed by Google India to conduct their applied CS program in my college. Google applied CS program was different than any other CS course. Here I had to teach different data structures through development of android application. Teaching college students is lot of fun and challenge, but I experienced the satisfaction of teaching only when I worked with Suryasanthan. It is a NGO that aims at empowering people who struggle to earn bread for their living. Here we helped people learn basic computer applications like MS Word, Excel so they could get a decent desk job.

This experience made me realise I would definitely want to keep teaching as T.A. when I join college.
