I was not the topper in my college, but surely was one of the richest student around in college. In sophomore year, when most of the students were staring to learn basics of data structures, I was freelancing and making android apps for startups. In junior year, I was teaching algorithms and data structures at a education firm named Coding blocks and later in the same year I qualified for GSOC. These endeavours apart from bringing money, brought loads of experience.

Establish the fact that you have interest in algorithms and machine learning

From childhood days, mathematics has been my favourite subject, it attracted me because there is nothing to be memorized. Everything in mathematics is simply based on logic and if  I forgot some formula, then I could simply derive it from my previous knowledge. Then I was introduced to programing as a fresher in college. Programming is similar to mathematics, here we first solve different smaller problems and then join them to solve the original problem. I still clearly remember my first programming class, our professor started the class by giving us a question. He asked us to tell the hundredth prime number within 10 minutes. After everyone failed, he just wrote a few line of code and within a second, we saw 541 being printed on the screen.  A few lines of code had magically solved a problem which human brain wasn’t able to solve. This small exercise had a huge impact on my career, though I didn’t understood the exact code that day, I knew this is something I would love to do for the rest of my life. After this I became very passionate about programming, I went well beyond the prescribed syllabus, learned different data structures, read numerous algorithms and started making different android applications. At the end of my freshman year I was getting freelancing offers that usually a junior or senior year student would get. I thought early development can be very beneficial and thus started a coding society in college named ‘Code Junkies’. Here me and my friend would teach algorithms and data structures. Our society was a success, the number of students increased every week.  

Apart from algorithms I got interested in machine learning. Machine learning is a superset of algorithms so my inclination was natural. I started machine learning from an online course by prof. Andrew Ng and then implemented it’s algorithms on some of my basic projects like facial expression detection and movie recommender systems. I presented both of them
as minor project in junior year and both of the time I was ranked in top ten projects. While working on recommender systems, I stumbled upon a paper titled ‘Clustering using same-cluster queries’ which was oral presentation appeared at NIPS 2016. I had some doubts in the paper, so I contacted the co-authors. Since then, we started working on a similar problem ‘Convergence properties of K-means with and without queries’. K means is a popular clustering algorithm. However, it comes with very few theoretical guaranties. Under what conditions would it reach a global minima, what datasets should k-means be applied? These are some important questions which do not have satisfactory answers in current literature. I performed certain experiments which showed that if data consists of well separated balls then with high probability  the kmeans algorithm finds the intended solution as long as initial choice of centres is satisfactory. We also provided theoretical guarantees for the same. Working on the problem gave me opportunity to interact with prof. yaoliang Yu  and some of his Phd students in university of Waterloo.   

Then establish your research inclination, np hard problems
